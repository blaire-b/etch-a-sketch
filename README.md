# etch-a-sketch

The goal of this project was to create an etch-a-sketch type game website. 

It was a bit easier to get started with this one, I was able to identify what needed to be done, and get to work creating the grid using Javascript & DOM manipulation. 

It became more challenging once I had to make a customizable grid. In the process of learning how to do that, I realized I could have made the first grid much easier without typing all the divs by hand, but that's the point of these assignments I suppose. I left it in as a reminder to myself to look for better solutions!
